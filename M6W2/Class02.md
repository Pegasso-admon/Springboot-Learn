## HTTP Methods in MVC Spring

This week focuses on learning Spring JPA and HTTP methods in Spring MVC. I'll learn how to use Spring JPA to interact with databases and handle HTTP requests in Spring MVC.

## HTTP Methods

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used for communication between web browsers and servers. It defines actions to perform on server resources.

The main HTTP methods are:

* **GET:** Requests a specific resource.

* **POST:** Sends data to create a new resource.

* **PUT:** Updates an existing resource with new data.

* **DELETE:** Removes a specific resource.

These methods enable building scalable web applications by managing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through APIs. In Spring MVC, annotations are used to map these methods to specific controllers.
